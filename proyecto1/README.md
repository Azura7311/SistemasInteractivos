The purpose of this project was to change the meaning and feeling of a not-released movie trailer. In this case, "Gladiator II" was chosen, an action movie, and the sound was edited to make it more funny and comedy-like.

Some techniques used:

- Filters (low and high pass, mainly used to increase/decrease focus on the main audio)
- Pitch changes (for comedy purposes)
- Trailer samples
- External audio effects
- Music (Credits to Peggy Suave)
- Volume amplification
